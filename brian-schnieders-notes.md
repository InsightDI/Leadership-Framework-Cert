### flow:
create leader's intent -> confirmation brief -> update leader's intent (if required) -> confirmation brief

## Confirmation Brief
> purpose: to reinforce intent and share understanding via dialog between leaders and team
- review leader's intent by restating the intent (be sure we heard what they meant)
- request any clarity
- update the leader's intent
- be sure know what 'done' looks like
if a billable project, this will take place during the customer kick off meeting
talk about the what and the why, NOT the how

> action items with owners and dates
included items:

goal: compare intended vs actual results

- mentor (battle buddy)
  - 1:1 peer relationships
